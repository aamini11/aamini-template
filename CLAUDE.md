## 🏗️ Architecture

This is an Astro 5 project with React integration. Key architectural decisions:

- **Framework**: Astro with React support for interactive components
- **Styling**: TailwindCSS 4.x for utility-first CSS
- **Package Manager**: pnpm (required - see packageManager field)
- **Node Version**: Requires Node.js >=22
- **TypeScript**: Strict configuration with comprehensive linting rules
- **Path Mapping**: `@/*` maps to `./src/*` for clean imports

## 🧪 Testing

- **Unit Tests**: Vitest with two test environments:
  - `node` environment for `.test.ts` files (Testing pure functions/lib code)
  - `jsdom` environment for `.test.tsx` files with React Testing Library (ui)
- **E2E Tests**: Playwright
  - Runs on `localhost:4321` in development
  - Uses screenshot testing with custom CSS
  - Automatic dev server startup for local testing

## 🔧 Development Tools

- **Linting**: oxlint with type-aware checking and zero warnings tolerance
- **Formatting**: Prettier with plugins for Astro, JSDoc, import organization,
  and TailwindCSS

## ⚡ Quick Start

1. Install dependencies: `pnpm install`
2. Start development: `pnpm dev`
3. Run all checks before committing: `pnpm verify`
